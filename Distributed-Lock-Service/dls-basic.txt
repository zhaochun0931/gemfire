In VMware GemFire / Apache Geode, the distributed lock function is provided through the DistributedLockService (DLS).

  org.apache.geode.distributed.DistributedLockService


This service allows multiple JVMs (members) in a GemFire distributed system to coordinate access to shared resources using cluster-wide locks.


✅
📌 How it works (conceptually)

Locks are named

Locks are cluster-wide

Only one member can hold a lock at a time

Lock state is managed internally by GemFire

Automatically released if the owning member disconnects or crashes



✅ 
🔑 Key Methods
Create a lock service
DistributedLockService dls =
    DistributedLockService.create("MyLockService", cache.getDistributedSystem());



✅
Acquire a lock
boolean locked = dls.lock("myLock", 10000, -1);


Parameters:

"myLock" → lock name

10000 → wait time (ms)

-1 → lease time (infinite)




✅
Try-lock (non-blocking)
boolean locked = dls.tryLock("myLock");

✅
Release a lock
dls.unlock("myLock");
