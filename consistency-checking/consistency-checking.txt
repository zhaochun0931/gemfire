Consistency checking requires additional overhead for storing and distributing version and timestamp information, as well as for maintaining destroyed entries for a period of time to meet consistency requirements.

To provide consistency checking, each region entry uses an additional 16 bytes. 
When an entry is deleted, a tombstone entry of approximately 13 bytes is created and maintained until the tombstone expires or is garbage-collected in the member. 

(When an entry is destroyed, the member temporarily retains the entry with its current version stamp to detect possible conflicts with operations that have occurred. The retained entry is referred to as a tombstone.)
