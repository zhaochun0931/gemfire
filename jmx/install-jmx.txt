Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a standard Java technology for monitoring and management.




MBean (Managed Bean)
A Java object that represents a manageable resource. There are four types—Standard, Dynamic, Open, and Model MBeans—but most use Standard MBeans, which are simple POJOs implementing a naming convention (e.g. MyResourceMBean interface and MyResource class).

MBeanServer
The registry that holds all your MBeans. It’s the core “hub” of the JMX agent.

Connector / Adapter
Allows remote clients (like JConsole, VisualVM, or your own tools) to talk to the MBeanServer over protocols such as RMI or HTTP.

JMX Agent
The JVM component that hosts the MBeanServer, connector(s), and adapter(s). It can be embedded in your application or run as a separate process.
