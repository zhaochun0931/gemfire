Portable Data Exchange (PDX) is Apache Geodeâ€™s data serialization protocol for cross-language objects and JSON data. When a PDX-serializable object is serialized for the first time, a PdxType is generated for it. The PdxType represents the data structure of that object and is used to serialize and deserialize it.

PdxTypes can proliferate in the TypeRegistry especially with unstructured JSON data. The structure of a class is the same for every instance of that class. The same is not necessarily true of JSON data. If uniquely-structured JSON data is added to a Region, it generates a PdxType specific to it. If that data is then deleted, its PdxType remains in the TypeRegistry and becomes an unused orphan.
