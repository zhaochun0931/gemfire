There are three important steps to connect a client application to the GemFire cluster.

The client application must have a class that implements the AuthInitialize interface. This class is used by GemFire to provide the credentials to the cluster.
The client application must set its credentials composed of two properties, security username and security-password.
The client application must set the security-client-auth-init property, which indicates to GemFire the class that implements the AuthInitialize interface

In this example, you will set the security-username and security-password in the class that implements the AuthInitialize interface.
